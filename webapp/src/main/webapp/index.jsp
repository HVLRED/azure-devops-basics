    <h2>Basics of DevOps:</h2>
    <p>
        DevOps is a software development approach that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps emphasizes collaboration, automation, and monitoring throughout the software development and deployment processes.
    </p>
    <h2>Basics of DevSecOps:</h2>
    <p>
        DevSecOps is an extension of DevOps that incorporates security (Sec) practices into the software development and deployment pipeline. It emphasizes the integration of security measures early in the development process, enabling organizations to deliver secure software at a faster pace. DevSecOps promotes a shift-left approach to security, where security considerations are addressed from the start of development and throughout the entire software lifecycle.
